            <h2>Life and Heroic Actions</h2>
            <p>Kanaklata Barua was born on December 22, 1924, in the Borangabari village of the undivided Darrang district of Assam, India. She was the daughter of Krishna Kanta and Karneshwari Barua. Her grandfather, Ghana Kanta Barua, was a famous hunter in Darrang. Kanaklata's ancestors were from the Dolakasharia Barua kingdom (Chutia vassal chiefdom) of the erstwhile Ahom state who relinquished the Dolakasharia title and continued retaining the Barua title.</p>

            <p>Her mother died when she was only five, and her father, who remarried, died when she reached thirteen. Despite facing early hardships, Kanaklata displayed remarkable resilience and determination. She attended school until class three but then dropped out to take care of her younger siblings.</p>
            
            <p>During the Quit India Movement, Kanaklata Barua joined the Mrityu Bahini, a death squad comprising groups of youth from the Gohpur sub-division of Assam. The British colonial rule in India was marked by oppression, exploitation, and cruelty. Kanaklata, along with many others, bravely raised her voice against this tyranny.</p>

            <p>On September 20, 1942, Kanaklata led a procession of unarmed villagers to hoist the national flag at the local police station in Gohpur, Assam. Despite warnings from the police, the procession continued marching ahead. When the police fired upon the procession, Kanaklata was shot, and the flag she was carrying with her was taken up by Mukunda Kakoti, who too was shot at. Both Kanaklata Barua and Mukunda Kakoti were killed in the police action. Kanaklata was just 17 years old at the time of her death.</p>
            
            <h2>Death and Commemoration</h2>
            <p>The Fast Patrol Vessel ICGS Kanak Lata Barua of the Indian Coast Guard, commissioned in 1997, is named after Barua. A life-size statue of her was unveiled at Gauripur in 2011. Her passionate speech before her death remains a source of inspiration for many.</p>
            
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Kanaklata Barua's sacrifice became a symbol of resistance and patriotism in India's struggle for freedom. Her bravery and determination inspire people to this day, reminding us of the price paid by those who fought for India's independence.</p>
